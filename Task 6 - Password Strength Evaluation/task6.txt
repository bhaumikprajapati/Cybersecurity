## 🔐 Best Practices for Strong Passwords:

- Use **at least 12–16 characters**.
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols**.
- Avoid **dictionary words**, names, and common sequences.
- Create **unpredictable combinations** (e.g., `M@nG0$Tea#74!`).
- Prefer **passphrases** (e.g., `Time4Tea@Sunset!Rocks`).
- Never **reuse passwords** across websites.
- Use a **password manager** to store and generate passwords.
- Always enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.

## ⚠️ Common Password Attacks:

1. **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all combinations to guess the password.
2. **Dictionary Attack:** Uses a list of common words/passwords to guess.
3. **Credential Stuffing:** Reuses leaked credentials on other platforms.
4. **Phishing:** Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake websites.

## 🧠 Key Learnings from This Task:

- Short and simple passwords (like `hiii123`) are cracked in seconds.
- Adding symbols and increasing length (e.g., `M@nG0$Tea#74!`) increases security.
- Passphrases are strong and easy to remember.
- Password evaluation tools give good insight into password strength.
- Understanding password attacks helps create better defenses.
