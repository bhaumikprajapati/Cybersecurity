Cybersecurity Internship - Task 1: Network Port Scanning

🔍 Objective:
To scan the local network and discover open ports using Nmap.

🛠 Tools Used:
- Nmap 7.97

🌐 Network Information:
- Local IP: 192.168.0.0
- Scanned Range: 192.168.0.0/24
- Hosts Found: 2

📊 Scan Summary:

Host 1: 192.168.0.1
- Open Port: 53 (DNS)
- Possible Device: Router or DNS Server

Host 2: 192.168.0.2
- Open Ports:
  - 135 (msrpc)
  - 139 (netbios-ssn)
  - 445 (microsoft-ds)
- Possible Device: Windows Machine

⚠️ Risk Analysis:
- Port 445 and 139 are commonly targeted in Windows SMB exploits.
- DNS port should be monitored for unusual activity.

✅ Recommendations:
- Disable unused ports and services.
- Use firewall rules to restrict access to internal systems.
- Regularly monitor network activity for anomalies.
