⚠️ Highlighted Vulnerability

Vulnerability Name: SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted  
Severity: Medium  
Plugin ID: 51192  
CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.5  
Description:  
The server's SSL certificate could not be validated or trusted. This could be due to self-signed certs, expired certs, or broken trust chains — increasing the risk of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  
Suggested Fix:  
Replace the certificate with one issued by a trusted public Certificate Authority (CA).
