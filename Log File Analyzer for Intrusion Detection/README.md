# üîç LOG FILE ANALYZER FOR INTRUSION DETECTION

A **Python-based cybersecurity tool** that analyzes system log files to detect and report potential security threats, such as brute-force SSH attacks and HTTP DoS or scanning behavior.  
Developed as part of a cybersecurity internship project.

## üß™ SAMPLE OUTPUT

- SSH Log Analysis: Detects brute-force attempts and reports IPs with repeated failed logins.
- Apache Log Analysis: Identifies IPs with abnormal request volume.
- Correlated Threats: Flags IPs appearing in both SSH and Apache logs.
- Visualization: Line graph of HTTP request activity over time.
