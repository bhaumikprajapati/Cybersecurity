📌 VPN Benefits:
- Encrypts all internet traffic
- Hides your real IP address
- Secures data over public Wi-Fi
- Prevents ISP and third-party tracking

⚠️ Limitations:
- Slightly slower internet speed
- Not 100% anonymous (VPN providers may log activity)
- Some websites block VPN access

🔐 Protocol Used – WireGuard (UDP):
WireGuard is a modern, fast, and secure VPN protocol. It uses advanced cryptography (like ChaCha20 and Curve25519) and has a lightweight codebase. WireGuard is faster and simpler than older protocols like OpenVPN, making it ideal for performance and privacy.
