Internship Task 5 â€“ Network Traffic Capture & Protocol Analysis using Wireshark

Objective:
To capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark and identify at least three different network protocols.

Tools Used:
- Wireshark (for packet capturing)
- Web browser (Chrome) to generate traffic

Steps Followed:
1. Installed Wireshark and launched it with administrator privileges.
2. Started packet capture on the active Wi-Fi network interface.
3. Opened and refreshed multiple safe websites:
   - https://example.com
   - https://www.wikipedia.org
   - https://www.python.org
4. (Accidentally also visited https://chat.openai.com during capture; no sensitive content was exposed due to HTTPS encryption.)
5. Applied protocol filters in Wireshark to analyze the following:
   - `dns` to view domain name resolutions
   - `tcp` to analyze connection setup and acknowledgment
   - `http` to view non-encrypted web traffic
6. Took screenshots of each protocol (with IP and MAC addresses blurred for privacy).

Protocols Identified:
- DNS (Domain Name System): Translates website names into IP addresses.
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures reliable data transfer with handshakes.
- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): Used for retrieving non-secure web content.

Privacy Measures:
- All screenshots were reviewed and edited to hide private IP addresses and MAC addresses.
- The .pcapng file was not uploaded due to presence of encrypted traffic involving ChatGPT, to avoid exposing domain-level usage.

Outcome:
This task helped me gain hands-on experience with Wireshark, protocol-level analysis, and network troubleshooting. It also strengthened my awareness of privacy and responsible data handling during packet captures.
