- Windows 11 (Local machine)
- GUI-based rule creation and deletion

‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed:

1. Opened Windows Defender Firewall using the `wf.msc` command.
2. Created a new **Inbound Rule** to block TCP traffic on **Port 23 (Telnet)**.

  - Firewall Interface.png
  - Firewall Rule.png

-----------------------------------------------------------
üìù Notes:
- Blocking port 23 is a standard security best practice due to Telnet's insecure nature.
- SSH on port 22 was allowed only for testing purposes (no SSH service active locally).
- No personal or sensitive information was exposed in the screenshots.
- All configurations were reverted post testing to maintain original system settings.
